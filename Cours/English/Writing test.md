# How much time do you spend on your phone ?

as for me, I think I use my phone between 2 hours and 30 minutes and 3 hours per day, because I use it for social media (instagram), to message my friends and to do research on the internet. But, in fact, less I spend time on it, better I feel, because I'm think I'm more productive when I don't use phone.

# What are the disavantages of too much exposure to phone ?

The disavantages of spending too much time on phone are the productivity is dicrease, we lose a lot of time and procrastinate a lot of task in stead of learning things for personnal projects or to improve ourselves. 
Except for people who need to call a lot of their clients like commercial or popular personnality who need social media to get popularity.
A big issue with phone, it's play on dopamine, so we unconsciously love to use it, and more we spend time on it more we become addict. Some studies have seen on new generation a real addiction with social media, mostly with the creation of tiktok, more and more people lose their time on watching useless contents.
In addition, in most of case, too much watching contents on social media dicrease our intelligence, because usually the contents isn't that smart 
Of course, some contents like space knowledge, english vocabulary learning, geography learning and more can be found and in this case social media improve our culture and knowledge, and this way, it's interesting to spend time on phone.

World Wide Web is best used when it's to share knowledge, or to meet and discuss with people where the  distance is a barrier.
